# Science Agent SDK

This is DP Tech's Science Agent SDK, providing a command-line tool `dp-agent` for managing scientific computing tasks.

## Installation

### Linux/Mac

```bash
pip install science-agent-sdk --upgrade
```

### Windows

In PowerShell, run:

```powershell
pip install science-agent-sdk --upgrade
```

## Usage

After installation, you can use the following commands:

### Fetch Scaffolding

```bash
dp-agent fetch scaffolding --type=calculation/device
```
